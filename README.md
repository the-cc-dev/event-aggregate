An aggregator for your events. Funnels events through a single point, so not all
of your code needs to attach listeners to every object. This approach is
particularly good for handling `error` events by UI components.

## Installation
```bash
$ npm i --save event-aggregate
```
## Overview
```js
var aggregate = require('event-aggregate');

module.exports = aggregate({
  error: [locationsStore, pathStore],
  change: [pathStore]
});
```

## API
#### aggregate()
Initialize the event aggregator. Takes an `{Object} config` as an argument,
which defines the event names as keys, and an array of emitters as the value.

When an event is received from an emitter, `event-aggregate` will emit the same
event.
```js
module.exports = aggregate({
  error: [myAsyncThing, myOtherAsyncThing],
  success: [myOtherAsyncThing],
  warning: [myAsyncthing]
});

// When 'myAsyncThing' emits an error, we will catch it,
// and emit the same error ourselves.
```
